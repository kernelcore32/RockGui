# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of our community is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and 
welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or disability.

We invite all those who participate in our community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem 
inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, but is not limited to, sexualized comments or jokes.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without 
warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can contact us via [contact information].

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the community organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in 
accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one 
communications pertaining to community business.
